# GA MY BOOTCAMP PREP: Course Website and Notes

A static web portal and notes for General Assembly's **My Bootcamp Prep** course.

## Setup

1. Sass files live at `assets/sass` and are compiled to `css/styles.css` by running `./bin/sass` from root.

## Instructor Notes:

### Day 1

The overarching goal of day 1 is to teach students HTML and CSS to that they will be well-prepared to create an application page if they desire to apply to WDI. The end portion of the day consists of the [Woodside Wheel](https://git.generalassemb.ly/mglumac/woodside-wheel-html-css-lab/) HTML/CSS Lab and time leading up to that point is structured to give students ability to complete lab in pairs. The lab can be scaled up or down by instructor by providing variable amounts of starter code.

- ***10am***
	- **Introductions** - (for students intros ideally have class form a circle)
	- **Course Overview** - make sure student are set up in slack and send them the course homepage. Talk through "Plan by Day" on homepage.
	- **Programming, Languages, Syntax**
		- Discussion about what programming languages students have heard of used.
		- Ask students what similarities and differences they see on syntax slide.

- ***11am*** - **HTML**
	- As you talk through HTML elements create a codepen based on a topic of student suggestion.  As you introduce new tags add to this codepen page. (Students don't need to code along.)
	- When introduce ul, li elements this is time to discuss elements going inside of other elements with nesting.
	- Topics that can touch on very quickly include HTML Page Structure, and depending on time can skip [turning GA press release codepen into a project folder](https://git.generalassemb.ly/mglumac/class01.html#/54)
- ***12:30pm*** - **Lunch**

- ***1:30pm*** - **CSS**
	- As talk through CSS properties can add to the codepen you've created to build a basic HTML page.
	- Topics that can touch on very quickly / skip include Hex/RGB, how to include CSS. Reference [starter](https://git.generalassemb.ly/mglumac/woodside-wheel-html-css-lab/blob/master/main.css) and [solution code](https://git.generalassemb.ly/mglumac/woodside-wheel-html-css-lab/blob/solution/main.css) to see CSS properties needed for Woodside Wheel lab.

- ***2:30pm*** - **Box Model** - Should culminate in students completing [Box Model Lab](https://git.generalassemb.ly/mglumac/box-model/) (Allot 30 minutes for lab)

- ***3:30pm*** **[Woodside Wheel](https://git.generalassemb.ly/mglumac/woodside-wheel-html-css-lab/)** - This lab should lead from discussion of HTML page layout and semantic elements.  Put the students into pairs and have them draw the box model for the page as done [here](https://pages.git.generalassemb.ly/mglumac/bootcamp-prep/notes/class01.html#/120).  Have them flesh out their box model with H1s, Ps etc.  Depending on the speed of class you can possibly code up the HTML skeleton together as a class before having groups work independently. If not, be sure to have given a recent demonstration of converting box model mockup into nested, indented HTML.

### Day 2
